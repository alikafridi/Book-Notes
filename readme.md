This repository will include notes on books I read. I'll highlight the parts that stood out to me. The goal is to be able to go back to these in the future to remind myself of the important points without having to re-read the entire book.



*Disclosure:* The notes are not meant to be summaries of the books. For almost all these books, I'll only write down the notes which stand out to me and that I know I'd want to remember later. You'll likely miss many concepts from these books if you just read my notes and not the books themselves
