## The Defining Decade

People embarking into their 20s are like planes taking off from New York City headed west. A slight shift in direction is the difference between landing in San Diego or landing in Seattle. A slight shift early is easy, but if you are farther along (or close to landing) only a huge detour will get you somewhere else.

Most psychologists believe: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” - Socrates. However the author believes: "An unlived life is not worth examining."

**Identity Capital** - Identity capital is our collection of personal assets—a repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. Some identity capital goes on a résumé … and other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselves—bit by bit, over time.

Don’t spend too much time in disengaged confusion. You will be in danger of becoming irrelevant.

A period of lostness can be really bad. It signals a bad period of time to employers, makes you more likely to be depressed. Underemployment is even worse than unemployment and can lead to a lot of depression later on in life. 

The strength of weak ties - give us access to something fresh. Information and opportunities that we don’t personally know. No idea where they’ll lead. May show you to new opportunities that can be transformative. Use these weak ties. 

The weakness of close ties - already know what they know most probably. Homogeneous group. Good for support and comfort but not for new opportunities.

It’s cool to use your internal networks and ask for help from others. 

**Benjamin Franklin effect -** people that have done you a favor in the past are more likely to do you a favor in the future, even more so than people who you have done a favor for and owe you. When we do someone a favor, we tend to think we like that person. Build up small favors into a larger favor. Just make sure the help isn’t a burden on the people helping you and it isn’t overwhelming. 

Be intentional. Do your research on the other person and present yourself as someone who is serious and has similar interests. Make yourself interesting and relevant. Ask for quick actionable items that the other person can easily do. 

Those who make choices are happier than those who are indecisive.

The lottery question is not right. You shouldn’t ask yourself what you’d do if you win the lottery, you should be asking yourself the opposite.

The most important part of being happy in life is being in an awesome relationship. However most people in their 20s treat relationships as something casual and unimportant. They assume they are too young to worry about settling down, getting married or having kids and would much rather focus on career or having fun. However this is the wrong approach, because these people then have a crisis at age 30. They end up getting worried about settling down and start panicking. They might end up settling for one of the first people they come across at that age rather than the person they would really want to be with. 

A similar issue relates to people assuming they have a lot of time to figure out what they want to do and instead can use their 20s to explore and have fun. However these people fall behind and once you’re behind, it becomes really hard to catch up. These people will earn less, be less happy, and suffer for the rest of their lives. Whatever happens, make sure that you are maximizing for Identity capital and keeping your long-term goal in mind. Even if you’re unsure of what you want to do, spend time testing new things with the hope that you’ll advance. Making a decision and pursuing it is better than being indecisive and trying to keep all your options open. 

**Cohabitation Effect** - Research shows that couples who move in together before marriage are usually less satisfied with their marriages and more likely to divorce. Supposedly this is not impacted by religion, culture, or age. 

One of the issues with cohabitation is that people slide into it - it just makes sense because you’re spending most of your nights together and the rent would be cheaper. Its often times practical and most couples assume it’s easy to slide out of it if it doesn’t work. However it’s actually really hard to get out of it because it’s hard to switch and easier to keep going. Also because you feel you’ve already invested so much that you don’t want to change. Switching costs seem a lot higher when it actually comes time rather than when you look at it way in the past. Age changes switching costs as well (30 changes everything). 

Very very common for people to regret moving in with someone because it makes breaking up harder. Recommended not to move in till engagement, although in todays world that’s often times not possible. Another option is to have a completely honest discussion about commitment levels from both parties before moving in. 

Traveling through a third world country with a significant other is a good test of compatibility and how things would work if you were raising a family together. You have a lot of fun and go through a bunch of adventures together. At the same time, you’re slightly uncomfortable being a place that is totally unfamiliar. You’re forced to spend all your time with the other person. You might have some struggles: money is tight, getting robbed, etc. Might get sick, sunburnt, or bored. How do you travel together? How do you each act with money (care-free or stick to a budget)? What do you want to do for fun - historical stuff/ruins, walks and hikes, go out in town or explore restaurants?

It’s good to meet a significant other who is similar to yourself, but look beyond the deal breakers. Age, ethnicity, religion, politics, career are basic general criteria but they are just the start. You need to dig deeper to find similarities. Couples with similar personalities are most likely to be happy, however in general people date someone with a different personality (the idea that opposites attract is not good for the long run). Personality usually stays the same over your entire life and it’s hard to change - so finding someone with a similar personality is extremely important. A common problem in young couples is that they think they are having fun and in good relationships but they are actually compromising a lot in order to reduce conflict. Too much of this can be a bad thing because it will eventually cause problems in the long-run.

The frontal lobe in humans doesn't fully develop till the mid to late 20s.

20 year olds react more to negative stimuli (criticism, fights, etc) while older adults react to positive. 

In your 20s, you'll be tempted to reach out to friends and loved ones when you have something that's troubling you. This is good to do sometimes, but you should learn to deal with things on your own as well. Learn to calm yourself. This will increase your confidence in yourself and make you better prepared for the future.

Many people believe you have "it" or you don't. "It" can be anything related to career or personality. Often this is something that comes from early childhood, you might be told you’re good at math so you start believing you have what it takes to succeed in math. Others might be told they don't have artistic capabilities, so they don't pursue art or have less confidence and thus feel they don't have it. This is false, although there might be a little bit of talent to the mix, the main thing is practice, perseverance and development. You can grow any skill. 

After age 35, staying pregnant becomes really hard --> miscarriages. Up to age 35, it takes about 4-5 months on average of trying before actually becoming pregnant. 1/4 of pregnancies after 35 result in miscarriages. About half of couples without kids in their 40+ are not childless by choice.

A really interesting thing --> if you have kids at 35+, and your parents had you at 35+, then you'll be fucked. You'll be caring for your kids at the same time that your parents will be getting old and need your help the most. For example when your kid is 10, your parents will be 80. This can be a huge financial and emotional strain that will become common in the upcoming generations. This could be a huge shift from what we experience today. One of the big things here is that this will impact educated families more, since they are the ones that tend to put off child birth longer. 

Author states that one of the most important thing for people is having kids, but in today’s culture most believe they can make the decision to have or not have kids in their mid-late 30s. That’s not true because a lot of women have trouble conceiving after 35, even though they are technically fertile. She believes women should have kids earlier if they know they want them, even potentially outside of marriage or super-early in a marriage. (I totally disagree with this). Author claims a lot of people use the fact they have examples of 40 somethings having kids to believe that it is easier nowadays, but in fact those are the vast minority. The press doesn’t cover the stats which show it is a lot harder after 35. 

Some people make the argument "why should I give up X (cigarettes, bad food, etc), why does it matter if I live till 85 or 95. I'd much rather enjoy life and live till 85". These people forget that the negatives impact you daily till you turn 85 (cancer, obesity, etc).
