#### Preface

There are additional helpful materials online at www.askthevc.com. 

- Under the resources section on this site, there are many standard forms of documents used in VC deals including the ones that Foundry Group uses



#### Introduction 

- Term sheets today are around 8 pages long. 
- The two key things that really matter in a term sheet are *economics* and *control*
- Individual VCs usually own less than 50 percent of a company, but have provisions that give them control over major company decisions.



#### Chapter 1 - The Players

1. **The Entrepreneur (Founder)**

   - Entrepreneurs should direct and control the financing process, even if they have a lawyer helping with the process
   - There can be multiple entrepreneurs for a company (co-founders) and ultimately one or more may end up leaving. Usually investors will structure terms to have systems in place to make this process smooth

2. **The Venture Capitalist (VC)**

   - The VC Hierarchy
     - *Managing Director (MDs)* / *General Partners (GPs)* are at the top. They make final investment decisions and sit on boards of directors of companies they invest in
     - *Pricipals* or *Directors* are next. They have some deal responsibility but generally need a managing director's support to move a deal through the VC firm.
     - *Associates* are typically not deal partners. They work directly for one or more deal partners. They work on a wide range of activiities including sourcing deals, helping with diligence on existing deals, and writing up internal memos about prospective investments. They also generally spend a lot of time on the **capitalization table (cap table)** - the spreadsheet that defines the economics of the deal.
     - *Analysts* are at the bottom of the ladder. They are generally very junior, often times recent college grads. In some firms analysts and associates play similar roles, while in others associates are more deal-centric. Generally have very limited power or responsibility.
     - Other players:
       - *Venture Partners* or *Operating Partners* - Usually experienced entrepreneurs who have a part-time relationship with the VC firm. They generally have the ability to sponsor a deal but often need explicit support of one of the managing directors just as a principal would. At some firms operating partners take an active role in managing investments as a chairman or board member but are not involved in new deals
       - *Entrepreneurs in Residence (EiRs)* - Experienced entrepreneurs who park themselves at a VC firm while working on figuring out their next company. Often will help VCs with introductions and diligence over a 3-12 month period. Some EiRs are paid, others just get free office space and an implicit agreement that the firm will invest in their next company
   - Treat whoever you work with from a VC firm with respect but founders should insist on developing a direct relationship with an MD or GP as well. Anyone other than a MD or a GP may not be with the firm over a long period of time. The MDs and GPs are the ones ultimately making investment decisions.

3. **The Angel Investor (Angels)**

   - Individual investors usually investing at the earliest stages of company financings. 

   - Angel investors should be accredited or have an appropriate exemption. Since the law related to this has changed recently, you should probably consult a lawyer to understand bringing on unaccredited angels.

   - *Super Angels* are angel investors that make a lot of small investments. They are generally well known in entrepreneurial circles and can be a huge help to early-stage startups

   - Angels are important but shouldn't be in a position to determine a company's direction. If there are many angels, you should consider setting up a special-purpose limited partnership controlled by one angel to be used as a vehicle for them to invest. Chasing down 75 signatures when wanting to a financing or selling a company is a pain.

     â€‹

     It's important to note that there isn't a generic angel or VC investor type. Never assume any of the groups are the same as others, each have their own incentives, pressures, experiences, and sophistication levels. 

4. **The Syndicate**

   - A syndicate is a collection of investors that invest together. This could be multiple VCs, angels, super angels, or any one else that purchases equity in the financing.
   - Most syndicates have a *lead investor* which is generally one of the VC investors. Some syndicated may have two or three co-leads for the syndicate
     - The lead in the syndicate is often responsible for negotiating terms for the entire syndicate
   - As a founder, you'll be responsible for communicating to each of the investors in the syndicate, not just the lead. 
     - The founder should insist that investors agree (at least verbally) that the lead investor can speak for the whole syndicate when it comes to investment terms. Otherwise you may need to renegotiate the same deal multiple times.

5. **The Lawyer**

   - An experienced lawyer who understands VC financings is invaluable for a founder. VCs do these deals often so understand the terms and processes well. An experienced lawyer is important for founders to effectively negotiate and understand where to focus their efforts. 
   - A lawyer not experienced in VC financings should not be used! Can cause huge issues in this process.
   - General costs for lawyers as of 2012 were between $5-$15K for very early stage financings and $25-40K for regular financing rounds. Most lawyers will agree to a modest fee cap for these financings.
     - Don't be shy insisting that the lawyer take a lower cap or only get paid from the proceeds of a deal.

6. **The Mentor**

   - Every entrepreneur should have a wide range of *mentors* who can help with the financing process as well as the business.
   - Early-stage entrepreneurs should avoid fee-charging advisers who offer to help in exchange for a fee. 
   - Mentors generally help entrepreneurs because they were likely helped when starting out. Mentors may become early angel investors or get a small equity grant for serving on the board of directors or board of advisers, but they don't generally ask for anything upfront.
   - Entrepreneurs should try to find mentors, work with them, and build long-term relationships.
   - Most great mentors that help startups do it because they enjoy it.
