## 7 Day Startup

##### by Dan Norris

#### Foreword

Dan's a natural born hustler, and _"it's this hustle that enabled him ot iterate, pivot, and brute force his way through multiple failed startup attempts and arrive at a startup success, WP Curve"_ .



#### Preface

_"You don't learn until you launch"_ 



#### The Author's own 7 Day Success

The author failed with his first few startups. Spent too much time trying to build businesses that never launched or grew too slowly.

With his first successful startup, WP Curve, he avoided missteps from his previous startups and launched in 7 days. The missteps he avoided included:

- Sexy ideas
- His own failures (forget about them, you can't worry about it now)
- Permission - no time to ask for other people's opinions
- Assumptions - there's no time to make and test assumptions. You just need to launch
- Small stuff like logo, business name, or design. Everything has to be up in a day
- Pricing Strategy - the author would set a price and let the customers tell him whether it was worth it
- The perfect payment gateway - don't make it look good, just have a way to collect money



#### What is a startup

A business is anything derives a wage for it founder. A startup however is more exciting and has:

1. High impact potential
2. High levels of innovation
3. High levels of uncertainty



_"If there's no innovation, then it's not a startup"._ 



#### Idea, Execution, Hustle

_"The goal of this book is to get you from wantrapeneur (someone who wants to be an entrepreneur) to entrepreneur"_ 

Most wantrapreneurs are failing at at least one of the three above, while successful startups are excelling at all three. Most single entrepreneurs can't do all three well, which is why many successful startups are founded by teams.

##### Ideas

Ideas matter. Dedicate a significant amount of time to it on Day 1. Most wantrapreneurs spend all their time on the Idea stage, when infact a startup requires execution and hustle as well.

##### Execution

_"Execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world"_

Customers don't care that you built the idea in a few days or that you're self-funded or that you're running on few resources. They're going to compare your product or serivce with your competitors. If you don't execute as well as your competition, the customers will pick them.

##### Hustle

_"Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time"_

_"Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers"_

Focus on hustle as soon as you launch. Ultimately this is the most important part of your startup - to start getting paid. Wantrapreneurs will spend time doing anything but doing this - adding features, improving the idea, designing the app, etc.



If one or more of Idea, Execution or Hustle aren't you, then find a cofounder to fill the gap.



#### Why 7 Days?

##### Avoid Failed Validation Techniques

_"There is a very big difference between someone entering their email and someone paying you each month for a product"_

Validation Techniques that don't really work:

- Validation doesn't work well when the answer isn't an obvious "YES"
- Email Opt-In/Beta Signup totals do not indicate purchase intent
- People saying "It's a Good Idea" doesn't mean that it is
- Coverage in Tech Press won't necessarily work
- Targeted surveys don't work
- Pre-Selling is a flawed
