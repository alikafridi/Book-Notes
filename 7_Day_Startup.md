## 7 Day Startup

##### by Dan Norris

#### Foreword

Dan's a natural born hustler, and _"it's this hustle that enabled him ot iterate, pivot, and brute force his way through multiple failed startup attempts and arrive at a startup success, WP Curve"_ .



#### Preface

_"You don't learn until you launch"_ 



#### The Author's own 7 Day Success

The author failed with his first few startups. Spent too much time trying to build businesses that never launched or grew too slowly.

With his first successful startup, _WP Curve_, he avoided missteps from his previous startups and launched in 7 days. The missteps he avoided included:

- Sexy ideas
- His own failures (forget about them, you can't worry about it now)
- Permission - no time to ask for other people's opinions
- Assumptions - there's no time to make and test assumptions. You just need to launch
- Small stuff like logo, business name, or design. Everything has to be up in a day
- Pricing Strategy - the author would set a price and let the customers tell him whether it was worth it
- The perfect payment gateway - don't make it look good, just have a way to collect money





#### What is a startup

A business just derives a wage for it founder. A startup however is more exciting and has:

1. High impact potential
2. High levels of innovation
3. High levels of uncertainty



_"If there's no innovation, then it's not a startup"._ 



#### Idea, Execution, Hustle

_"The goal of this book is to get you from wantrapeneur (someone who wants to be an entrepreneur) to entrepreneur"_ 

Most wantrapreneurs are failing at at least one of the three above, while successful startups are excelling at all three. Most single entrepreneurs can't do all three well, which is why many successful startups are founded by teams.

##### Ideas

Ideas matter. Dedicate a significant amount of time to it on Day 1. Most wantrapreneurs spend all their time on the Idea stage, when infact a startup requires execution and hustle as well.

##### Execution

_"Execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world"_

Customers don't care that you built the idea in a few days or that you're self-funded or that you're running on few resources. They're going to compare your product or serivce with your competitors. If you don't execute as well as your competition, the customers will pick them.

##### Hustle

_"Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time"_

_"Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers"_

Focus on hustle as soon as you launch. Ultimately this is the most important part of your startup - to start getting paid. Wantrapreneurs will spend time doing anything but doing this - adding features, improving the idea, designing the app, etc.



If one or more of Idea, Execution or Hustle aren't you, then find a cofounder to fill the gap.



#### Why 7 Days?

##### Avoid Failed Validation Techniques

_"There is a very big difference between someone entering their email and someone paying you each month for a product"_

##### Work More Efficiently

_"It's proven in research. You work more efficiently when you are close to a deadline. If you are a long way out, you make tasks up that you think are important. As a result, you don't get any of the important work done."_

_"Before you start a task, your brain visualizes the hardest parts to come. It then tries to simulate real work by focusing on small mindless tasks. In other words, you spend hours and days fussing over logos and website copy instead of selling your product"_

_"â€¦ entrepreneurs are rarely the investors who came up with breakthrough technologies. Instead, they are people who took a small problem and worked it to death until they found a solution that gained traction."_

_"If you have a conversation with a friend about your business idea this month, and next month you are having the same conversation, you are a wantrapreneur"_ 

##### But 7 Days isn't enough

_"You can't deliver on your whole grand vision, but you can launch something. When you do, you can start talking to people who are paying you money. This is when you start making sensible business decisions and avoid assumptions"_ 



#### The 7 Pre-Launch Tasks

_"Don't bother with tactics to 'find your ideal market' or 'create your unique selling proposition' or 'practice your elevator pitch'. These activities are pointless before you launch because they are based on assumptions."_

Schedule

- **Day 1** - Come up with an idea
- **Day 2** - Build an MVP
- **Day 3** - Create a business name
- **Day 4** - Need a landing page or some sort of online presence
- **Day 5** - Get your business in front of people for free
- **Day 6** - Determine what success means how to measure it. Set goals and plan to make changes if goals aren't met
- **Day 7** - Launch!




#### Day 1 - The 9 Elements of a Great Bootstrap Business

1. **Enjoyable daily tasks** - Pick a business that you would enjoy building out. It'll keep you motivated.
2. **Product/Founder fit** 
3. **Scalable Business model** - Must be something that can grow into a large company and you have the ability to grow the business month over month. SaaS businesses are much easier to grow revenues with. 
4. **Operates profitability without the founder** - Build something where you can later hire staff or systems to replace you and you can maintain profitability
5. **An asset you can sell** - Create something that adds real value to customers
6. **Large market potential** 
7. **Tap into pain or pleasure differentiators**
8. **Unique lead generation advantage** - how are you going to generate customer leads for your business in a differentiated way from competitors?
9. **Ability to launch quickly** - choose something you can launch and modify quickly. Once you're getting data from paying customers you can iterate to get the product right.

Choose a business that meets these criteria. You can always tweak the idea later, but if your idea doesn't meet the criteria above it will be a hard problem to solve.

Other things to consider:

- _Don't pick low-hanging fruit_ - Creating a startup means creating real value for customers. Don't get caught up in get-rich schemes or attempts to make a passive income.
  - _"We are talking about launching a real startup here. Something that gives you a purpose, creates something original in the world, and builds long term value. You need to think about how you can truly create something."_
- _Don't try to be Steve Jobs_ - Don't let your creative side take over your entrepreneurial side. Create a product that people wnt and sell it to them
  - _"Playing the visionary is a privelege reserved for second- and third-time entrepreneurs. It's fun, but it's fraught with danger."_

For your first startup, the best way to go about it is:_"Solve problems where people are already paying for solutions"_

_"Everyone might be saying that your idea is great, but look at whether or not they are currently paying for a solution to the same problem"_ 

##### Day 1 Task: 

- Brainstorm a bunch of ideas and evaluate them against the criteria. Choose the idea that stands out as being the best option for you. 




#### Day 2 - WTF is an MVP

_"A common MVP mistake is over emphasizing the 'minimum' and under-emphasizing the 'viable'"_

You need to try to mimic the experience the customer will get in your final product, but spend the least amount of time trying to get it set up. Short-term pain is okay if it helps you validate your business. Forget automation, manual is okay in the early days.

You should charge from Day 1, and charge the amount you expect to be paid for the final product. Your initial product should target the same customers you would hope to have in the end for your startup. You should be able to build the MVP in 7 days and get it to a point where you can offer it to customers at the end of the 7 days.

##### Day 2 Task:

- Write down exactly what you'll launch on Day 7. What will your customers get, what is included, and what is excluded? If necessary, write down what is automated and what will be done manually in the short-term.



#### Day 3 - Choose a business name

Don't spend too much time picking a name, it is a distraction. You can always change it later. Chances are you'll pivot anyways so a names not too important. That said you shouldn't pick an awful name.

Apple was named after the farm where Steve Jobs dropped acid. Google was initially called 'Backrub'.

First come up with a list of options and then pick one. To come up with options, you can get started with:

- **A place** - Apple was named after an apple farm. Adobe was named after a creek outside the founder's house
- **Combine two works to create a new one** - Aldi is a combo of "Albrecht" (name of the founders) and "discount". Intel combined "Integrated Electronics". Groupon combined "Group Coupon"
- **Use an acronym for your service** - IBM stands for "International Business Machines"
- **Look for industry terms** - For _WP Curve_, WP is a common acronym for WordPress
- **Use the dictionary** - Jack Dorsey liked the name Twitch so he looked at works around it in the dictionary and found the word "Twitter"
- **Extend a related word** - Author put 'inform' into wordoid.com to come up with Informly
- **Outsource it** - crowdSPRING.com is one site that will get others to come up with a business name for you, but the one day turnaround might cause an issue. You can use social media

Where the name comes from doesn't really matter.

Come up with 10 names that aren't ridiculous, then apply the framework below to pick the best one:

1. **Is it taken?** 

   Check if there is a trademark in your region (use uspto.gov/trademarks). Is the .com taken? Is the Twitter handle taken (use know.com to see which social profiles are taken)?

2. **Is it simple?** 

   A simple name is more memorable. Try to avoid making up works. Don't use misspelling or words that people commonly misspell. Try to keep it under 12 characters. 

3. **Is it easy to say out loud?**

   Important for word of mouth growth. 

4. **Do you like it?**

   You'll have to say it a lot so you better like it

5. **Does it make sense for your idea?**

   Big bonus if the name portrays what your idea is

6. **Broader is better**

   You very likely might pivot, so good to keep a broad name

##### Day 3 Task

- Come up with a bunch of potential business names and evaluate them against the criteria above. Choose whichever one makes most sense to you and run with it.



#### Day 4 - Buid a website in one day for under $100

The purpose of a landing page:

1. Start communicating with customers
2. Learn how they will respond

Steps to take for landing page:

1. Ensure site is designed to capture email addresses even before you launch
2. Create a site that pre-sells your product before you launch
3. Create the actual sales page that you'll use on launch day

It's imperative that on Day 7 you have a page with a payment button. 

Even before you launch on Day 7, it can be good to get a simple landing page up which says something about your idea. 

_The author runs through steps on how to set up a site on wordpress. I'm not taking notes here since its not too useful to me personally._

A basic marketing funnel:

- User navigates to website and leaves email in return for a freebie that helps solve a problem they have
- Over time you send them useful information about the problem
- When they are ready to buy, they visit your payment page and purchase

Paypal is a simple easy way to collect money early. 

- The copy on your site is really important in closing deals
- Images make a huge difference. A professionally designed theme is a good place to start, and the images you add in will have a big impact
- Set up google analytics so you can understand how people are using the site

##### Day 4 Task

- Build yourself a website.
